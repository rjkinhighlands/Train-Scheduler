# Train-Scheduler
 Firebase backed train schedule application
 
Objectives

Created a Firebase backed train schedule application

Used HTML, CSS, and jQuery to render the schedule and admin panel on the web page.

Firebase is hosting a globally available set of data that will be retrieved and manipulated using Moment.js to provide up-to-date information about various trains' arrival times and minutes to arrival.

My app utilizes "minutes to arrival" and "next train time" update on the screen (without refresh).
